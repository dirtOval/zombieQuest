zombies!

okay so it seems kind of fun to have a limited ammo system.
or like, you can choose to shoot zombies but it limits your
ability to fight later.

also a health system. you can only take so many hits before you die.

SETTING:
warehouse, looking for food. it goes horribly wrong because zombies.
maybe you're traveling with someone, but they get eaten (or not) based
on your choices.

looking for food:
>look in the basement
>look in the freezer section
>look upstairs

basement:
a zombie pops out!
>fight (you kill it, -1 ammo return to looking for food)
>run (corner yourself, fight or die, then return to looking for food

freezer section:
a shit ton of rotting food! the noise attracts zombies,
and soon you're surrounded.
>fight (you run out of ammo, try to run past (die) or shut in freezer)
>shut in freezer. (go to shut in freezer)
>call for help (your buddy runs in shooting, but gets grabbed from behind. you escape but your buddy is dead and you're being chased)

chased:
>run away (bad end #1. You made it out alive but still no food and your only friend is dead)
>run upstairs (go to upstairs, minus partner)

shut in freezer:
>call for help (no point. can't hear)
>wait (it's a loop. you wait and it does nothing)
>fight your way out (if you have bullets. uses up your remaining bullets, you get cornered)
>end it.

upstairs:
there's an office and a vending machine in the hall.
> smash vending machine (you get snacks but the noise attracts zombies)
>investigate office. (go to office)
>go back downstairs

office:
dead guy, blew his brains out. shotgun, box of shells on the table.
>get shotgun (now you have shotgun, can survive zombie attack)
>eat corpse (what the fuck are you thinking, absolutely not.)
>leave

smash vending machine:
you grab up all the snacks and goodies you can, zombies start coming
upstairs
>run to office (office but zombies banging on door)
>fight (succeed if bullets full, empties bullets. otherwise fail)
>call for help (partner draws them away)

partner running away:
>save partner (if you have shotgun succeed, otherwise you die)
>save yourself (bad end #2. you get food but lose your partner. you bastard)

save partner successfully:
partner found tons of food! you're gonna make it!
only . . . your partner has some blood on them
>ask about blood (partner says they had to fight a zombie but you didn't hear any gunshots)
>shoot them in the back (bad end #3. you get all the food but your partner is dead, and you are a bastard)
>trust your partner (neutral ending, you leave with the food and to an uncertain fate)

fight your way out:
you are victorious! But your partner won't stop eyeing you suspiciously. they think you were bit!
>pretend to be a zombie (they shoot you)
>deny it (good ending, you escape with food but are unsure if partner plans to kill you)
>say nothing (everything happens so fast, your partner draws their gun
and you draw yours and if you have bullets you win and if you don't you die)
